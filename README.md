The data was analysed to help identify some important Key Performance indicators so as to influence important business decisions.

## Analysis
### Revenue:
The first image contains the total revenue( total sales ) generate by the organisation on all its products over the course of 4 years. The image also contains the average profit, total profit, total quantity of goods sold and total discounts given by the organisation. The values were arrived at by using the sum functions on excel. However, the average profit was arrived by using the average funtion and the quantity sold arrived at by the count function on excel.
